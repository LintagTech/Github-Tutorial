# Github-Tutorial

Basic tutorial on how to Git and GitHub.

Download these:
[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) <-- Try to hold off on using this. Makes git easier on your local machine but you should do it the right way first.

Git and Github are not the same. Github is the web UI to host your Git repositories. Git is a powerful version control system that enables you to maintain a progressive workflow in which you can create, commit and update changes, make branches, merge/rebase work and undo changes in a project. Makes your life easier and is great for collaboration.
